# Documentation Formatting

## Headers

*   h1 should only be used for Document titles or main sections of the document.
*   Headers are used in a heiarchial manner from h1 to h5.
*   Headers 2-5 are used for each new section in a heiarchial pattern.

## Plain Text

*   Plain text that follows a header should use a p tag. (See Source)

## Example Header

Example plain text under a header with whitespace.

## Use of Whitespace

*   Make sure there is a space between each header and text by either using a break, enclosing the text in a p tag, or using ordered or unordered lists.

## Keystrokes / Instructions

*   Keystrokes are represented in **bold** and surrounded by brackets []. Example: Press the **[Enter]** key.
*   Key combinations should be represented the same as the above with plus signs (+) separating them. Example: Press and hold the **[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del]** keys together.
*   Actions required by the user should be represented in **bold**.

*   Buttons should be represented in _italics_.  
    Example: **Click** _Next_

*   Code that should be written, text that should be typed, commands that should be entered into the command line should be represented in `monospace font using the code tag`. Example: **Type** `*.bat` into the Search Box, then hit **[Enter]**.
*   All linkable text should be linked where appropriate. Example:
    1.  **Browse** to [Google](http://google.com "Google.com").
        *   Links should have default formatting.
