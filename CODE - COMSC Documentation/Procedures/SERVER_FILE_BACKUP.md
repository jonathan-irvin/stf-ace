# Performing a Full File Backup of the Server

1.  Log into the server.
2.  Insert an external HDD into an available USB port.
3.  Press the **[Windows key]** on the keyboard (located between the Ctrl and Alt keys)
4.  **Click** on the **Computer** option in the Start Menu.
5.  When Windows detects the external HDD, open the drive from the window that pops up.
    *   To create a new folder for the backup, **Click the Right Mouse Button**.
    *   _Move_ your mouse over the **New** menu option.
    *   **Click the Left Mouse Button** on the **Folder** menu option.
    *   A folder icon should appear labelled as "New Folder" with the immediate option to change its name. Note: If you click away from this, the folder will have a default name of "New Folder".
    *   Name the folder something meaningful such as the time and date the backup is for and the name of the machine, then press the **[Enter]** key.
    *   **Click the Right Mouse Button** on **Desktop** in the left sidebar and _select_ the **Copy** menu option.
    *   If your external HDD is still in focus, **Double-click the Left Mouse Button** on the folder you created a moment ago. The folder should now be in focus.
    *   **Click the Right Mouse Button** within the folder and _select_ the **Paste** option.
        *   A progress window should now appear and display the status of the copy operation.
        *   Depending on the number of files, this operation could take several minutes to hours.
        *   Once the operation has run for a couple of minutes, there should be an estimate for the amount of time it will take for the operation to complete.
6.  There will not be a audio notification when the operation completes, but you will know it has finished when the progress window disappears.
